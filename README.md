# Manual

```console
$ chmod +x ./install.sh
$ chmod +x ./steal_config_please.sh
$ # Install:
$ ./install.sh # who would've guessed?
$ # Update files in the repo:
$ ./steal_config_please.sh 
```

*Why it copies files instead of linking?*

Emacs breaks symlinks for some reason for me, so copying for now.
